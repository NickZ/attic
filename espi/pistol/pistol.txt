Here's a silly looking poorly animated pistol, but pistol nevertheless.. :)

pisga0 = -208:-89
pisgb0 = -210:-90
pisgc0 = -212:-91
pisgd0 = same as pisgb0.
pisge0 = same as pisga0.

I can only wonder why the last two frames are in the IWAD but aren't used by the game.

the 320x200.gif could be used for any suitable graphic, like intermission screen.
