Fix for the damn chaingun sprites which were annoying the fuck out of me for 
two reasons:

1) goddamn huge sprites (320x200 as to avoid aligning them apparently)
2) horrible overlapping

Both of those are fixed now, and also it doesn't break in the latest version 
of zdoom like it used to (for some reason it reverted to the old doom2.wad 
sprites when idle).  I think it may have been the order they were in but 
I dunno.
